A bioinformatics tool designed to enable rapid recovery of high-quality draft genomes of microbial eukaryotes from various environmental metagenomic samples.

- reference-independent and cultivation-free
- separate reads or contigs into five groups: Bacteria, Archaeal, Eukaryotic, Viral, and Unknown. 
- generate a fasta file with Euk and unknown contigs for binning


## Overview

Eukfinder has two different modes of operation based on the input files:

- (a) Illumina short reads workflow (Eukfinder_short): Short reads are first classified into five taxonomic categories (Archaeal, Bacterial, Viral, Eukaryotic, and Unknown) using Centrifuge (DB1) and PLAST (DB2). Reads classified as 'Eukaryotic' or 'Unknown' are assembled into contigs using metaSpades. These contigs are then reclassified with Centrifuge and PLAST. Contigs assigned as 'Eukaryotic' or 'Unknown' are combined and treated as potential eukaryotic sequences, which can be further analyzed for downstream binning and genome recovery.

- (b) Metagenome assembled contigs or long-read sequencing workflow (Eukfinder_long): For MAG assembled contigs or long-read sequencing data generated by Nanopore or PacBio platforms, the workflow performs a single round of classification to select 'Eukaryotic' and 'Unknown' contigs. These selected contigs are combined and treated as potential eukaryotic sequences, ready for further binning and downstream analysis.
