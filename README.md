A bioinformatics tool designed to enable rapid recovery of high-quality draft genomes of microbial eukaryotes from various environmental metagenomic samples.

- reference-independent and cultivation-free
- separate reads or contigs into five groups: Bacteria, Archaeal, Eukaryotic, Viral, and Unknown. 
- generate a fasta file with Euk and unknown contigs for binning


## Overview
Schematic representation of eukfinder workflows. eukfinder is a taxonomic classification-based bioinformatics approach to retrieve microbial eukaryotic nuclear and mitochondrial genomes from WGS metagenomic sequencing data. eukfinder has two different workflows based on the input files:

- (a) using Illumina short reads, it first classifies Illumina reads into 5 distinct taxonomic categories (Archaeal, Bacterial, Viral, Eukaryotic, and Unknown), after assembling the Eukaryotic and Unknown reads together, second round of classification and supervised binning, it will output Eukaryotic nuclear and mitochondrial genomes.
- (b) using MAG assembled contigs or long-read sequencing data generated by Nanopore or Pacbio platforms. It goes through one round of classification to select Eukaryotic and Unknown contigs, and after supervised binning generates Eukaryotic nuclear and mitochondrial genomes.
